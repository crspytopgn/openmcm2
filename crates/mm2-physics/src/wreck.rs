//! The rider thrown off in a crash, after the game's Wrecker (wrecker.cpp,
//! update 0x535d50).
//!
//! The game does not use a jointed ragdoll. The rider is one rigid body
//! that plays a crash motion from Rider.mcf while it tumbles:
//!
//! * A crash on the ground starts a **bail** (0x537890): a motion chosen by
//!   the kind of crash (Endo, Kahuna, BackOver, LeftOver, RightOver, list
//!   +0x48) plays with the rider still on the bike, and once it is half
//!   done the rider is let go with the speed and spin the motion had.
//! * A crash in the air **tumbles** at once (0x537980): one of Fall01 to
//!   Fall04 at random (list +0x50), blended in over 0.5 s, the body thrown
//!   with the bike's speed and spin.
//! * When the body first lands it plays one of LeftHit, RightHit,
//!   FeetHitL, FeetHitR or HeadHit at random (list +0x58) and slides to a
//!   stop; then the rider is put back on the bike.
//!
//! The body touches with Rider.col's six part shapes (loaded in
//! 0x535830), which move with the motion playing; the viewer hands their
//! posed corners over. The deepest corner in the ground is answered by the
//! rider's collision model (0x43cd50): no bounce (+0xb8 = 0), only 5 %
//! of the impulse that would stop it (1 − +0xf4, 0.95), at most 2000, and
//! the body's speed and spin cut by 0.99 × the step's time (+0xf0). The
//! body's inverse inertia is zeroed (0x4a2950 into +0x1d0), so contacts
//! never turn it; the fall motions do the tumbling. Until the corners are
//! set the body touches as one sphere. 0x538050
//! also keeps the parts out of the bike: a box in the bike's model space
//! (centre (0, 2, 0), half size (0.5, 1.5, 3) ft, set in 0x4924e6) pushes
//! any part inside it out at 5 × its depth per second. 0x537690 only
//! throws dirt where the parts slide.
