//! The computer riders' bike (`Bike_SimulateSimple` 0x414000 and its
//! two-wheel solver 0x40faa0; see `docs/physics.md` sections 4 and 8).
//!
//! The bike is a dumbbell: a front and a rear point 3.5 ft either side of
//! the model's origin, each on a spring of its own. The rear drives and
//! brakes toward the line's speed limit, the front is steered straight at
//! the line (no bars: its level velocity is turned by at most a fifth of
//! its speed a step), and the rear's sideways velocity is taken out
//! whole. The bike's up leans with the sideways pull. Everything here is
//! the game's own numbers, including its slips: the rear's final ground
//! check uses the front's spring and last substep's rear point, and the
//! air lean is one value shared by every computer rider.
