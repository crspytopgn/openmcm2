//! The player's bike, after the game's full model (`Vehicle::Simulate`
//! 0x52ffb0 and the Bike and KrustyBike overrides it calls; see
//! `docs/physics.md` section 5).
//!
//! The game's model is a hybrid, and this follows its split:
//!
//! * **Forces move the body.** Gravity, drag (0x40c210), the shocks
//!   (0x52eac0), the drive at the rear tyre (0x492b20), the brakes
//!   (0x519850) and the tyres' rolling and side friction (0x51b1d0) add up
//!   to one force, integrated in full once the race is running (0x506ed0)
//!   and only vertically before the start (0x497590). Resistances share a
//!   budget so that together they never reverse the bike in one step.
//! * **Pitch is a torque**, from the shocks and brakes; only its pitch part
//!   is kept.
//! * **Turning and lean are kinematic.** Steering bends the velocity like
//!   a bicycle (R = wheelbase / sin(steer), 0x52d800) and the body yaws
//!   with it, plus a power slide when the rear spins up while leaned
//!   (0x40ce00); the bike leans towards a target from the turn rate and the
//!   steering (0x40c830).
//! * **In the air** (0x40bcc0) the rider's lean pitches the bike and the
//!   bars yaw it; the gas and brake can also tip it (the gyro options), and
//!   the bike rights its roll.
//!
//! It runs in the game's fixed 0.02 s steps. Units are feet, seconds,
//! pounds and slugs.
