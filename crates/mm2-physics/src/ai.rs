//! How the game's computer riders follow a line (BikeAI: the path follower
//! 0x40f310; see `docs/physics.md` section 9).
//!
//! A rider's line is a polyline of up to 200 points with a look-ahead
//! distance (+0x974) and a speed limit (+0x96c). Each frame the rider
//! finds where it is along the line and aims at the point the look-ahead
//! further on, moved sideways by its own lane offset. Before a jump the
//! trajectory planner 0x40e000 ([`Path::plan_jump`]) sets the speed the
//! rider needs to clear it, and points the rider at the landing.
