//! The 3D countdown numbers (`NumberObjectManager`, built in 0x48ccb0 and
//! run by 0x48cf70): five `ArcadeObject`s (0x401310), `one.slt` to
//! `five.slt`, held in front of the race camera. Only in a race (race mode
//! `0x2d70` not 0), and only while the race's own camera is the one in use.
//!
//! * Before the gate drops, when there is no 30-second man (he does the
//!   counting on his board when he is out): the number is the seconds left
//!   (race +0x15c), rounded down, plus one, so 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 over the last
//!   five of the 5.2 s.
//! * Otherwise, while the player has been off the course for over a second
//!   (bike +0x76c), they count down to the reset at 6 s: 5 from 1 s off, 1
//!   from 5 s.
//!
//! The number stands 6 ft ahead of the camera and 2.5 ft along its up
//! (0x555c2c, 0x556000), facing the way the camera looks, and is sized as
//! the arrow is, so that its largest side would be 30 pixels of the 640×480
//! screen 3 ft away (0x419bfd's 0x1e and 3.0).
