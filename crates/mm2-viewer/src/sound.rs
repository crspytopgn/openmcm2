//! Race sounds as the game's `Audio.cpp` (RaceSound) plays them
//! (`docs/physics.md` section 15, `docs/sound.md`).
//!
//! The engine note is not pitch-shifted: recorded samples from
//! `RES/ENGINE.RES` (listed in `Audio_16.ini`, or `Audio_08.ini` for 8-bit
//! sound) play whole, one after another, in a small state machine
//! (0x4e8720, 0x4e9aa0). Opening the throttle picks a torque band by speed,
//! which runs on into the power band, which alternates with sputters;
//! closing it plays the decel, which runs on into the idle loop. A change
//! of state rewrites the stream from the write cursor, so it is heard at
//! once. Each bike uses its own engine class's samples; the four bikes
//! nearest the camera have a voice.
//!
//! Every engine, landing, wreck and fall is a DirectSound 3D buffer: the
//! listener is the camera, moving with the followed bike, and each sound
//! falls off as min/distance between its minimum and maximum distance and
//! is Doppler-shifted (0x4e81a0: distance factor 0.3048 m/ft, rolloff and
//! Doppler factor 1). Crashes, landings, the crowd and its reactions come
//! from `RES/AUDIO.RES`.
