//! Visual Cues (F4): the green arrow at the bottom left of the screen that
//! points where the player should head (`VisualCue`, 0x48bd00), and in a
//! lap race the five runway lights that run along the course where the
//! player left it (`RunwayLights`, 0x48b560).
//!
//! * The arrow is an `ArcadeObject` (0x401310) held in front of the camera:
//!   3 ft ahead, a tenth of the way across the screen and 85% of the way
//!   down, sized so that its largest side is 45 pixels of the 640×480
//!   screen, and turned to look from the camera at its target (0x48c0a0).
//!   The target is the gate the player rides for in a Baja or Enduro race;
//!   in a lap race the confirmed place on the course, shown only while the
//!   player is off the course; in Moto-Tag IT, or the ball. It hides once
//!   the player has finished.
//! * The lights (0x48b700) stand 6, 3, 0, −3 and −6 ft along the course from
//!   the confirmed place, each 4 ft above the ground and upright on it, and
//!   only while the player is off the course. One at a time is lit, from the
//!   back to the front, a quarter of a second each, round a 1.375 s cycle.
